BEN CALHOUN CS124 PROJECT 1

The dataset I will be using is "1000 Used Car Price Data".

It contains the data of 1000 used cars.

Attributes:

Name- Model/Year of the vehicle

Price- The price of the vehicle

Mileage- How many miles the vehicle has driven

Review- The review of the vehicle (out of 5)

Review_count- The number of reviews the vehicle has received

Badge- Rates the quality of deal of the vehicle

Price/Mileage is unique for each record.

I chose this data set because I am interested in cars in general and how they are percieved on the market. I probably wouldn't have chosen this data set if it didn't include average review and review count (marketing aspect). The attributes are ordered by year/model, price, mileage, review, review count, and a badge indicating the general quality of the deal. I was able to print my data as well as a calculation to determine the price of the most expensive car. I know my function works because it successfully displays the largest price. I chose to do this calculation because I wanted to get a sense of the range of quality of these used cars.
